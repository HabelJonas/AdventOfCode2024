# AdventOfCode2024

## About
This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges. Each day of December, a new programming challenge is released, and this repository will be updated with my solutions.

## Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each day of the challenge:
- `Day01/`
- `Day02/`
- `Day03/`
- ...

Each folder contains:
- `input.txt`: The input data for the challenge
- `Program.cs`: The C# code that solves the challenge

## Getting Started
To run the solutions, you need to have .NET installed. You can download it from [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### Running a Solution
1. Navigate to the folder of the day's challenge, e.g., `Day01/`.
2. Run the following command:
    ```sh
    dotnet run
    ```
